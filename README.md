ðŸŒ¾ AI-Assisted Flag Leaf Measurement & Yield Prediction

This project leverages YOLOv8 and Machine Learning to automate flag leaf detection and assist in crop yield prediction for wheat. By analyzing UAV/drone field images, our system detects wheat flag leaves and provides insights that help farmers and researchers make informed decisions about crop productivity.

ðŸš€ Features

Flag Leaf Detection: Uses YOLOv8 object detection to identify wheat flag leaves in UAV images.

Automated Measurement: Calculates flag leaf size and area from bounding boxes.

Yield Prediction: Trains a regression model to predict wheat yield based on extracted features.

Streamlit Web App: User-friendly interface to upload images, visualize detections, and get yield predictions.
