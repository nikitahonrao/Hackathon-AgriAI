<h1>ðŸŒ¾ AI-Assisted Flag Leaf Measurement & Yield Prediction</h1>

This project leverages YOLOv8 and Machine Learning to automate flag leaf detection and assist in crop yield prediction for wheat. By analyzing UAV/drone field images, our system detects wheat flag leaves and provides insights that help farmers and researchers make informed decisions about crop productivity.

<h4>ðŸš€ Features</h4>

<h2>Flag Leaf Detection:<h2></h2> Uses YOLOv8 object detection to identify wheat flag leaves in UAV images.

<h2>Automated Measurement:</h2> Calculates flag leaf size and area from bounding boxes.

<h2>Yield Prediction:</h2> Trains a regression model to predict wheat yield based on extracted features.

<h2>Streamlit Web App:</h2> User-friendly interface to upload images, visualize detections, and get yield predictions.
